Common-Collections
==================

Contains potentially faster implementations of Java collections.  New collection principles are based on big data database principles and lazy evaluation.  The goal is provide a List implementation that appends elements faster than the normal array list implementation, can insert and remove elements within the list with O(log(n)) time, and read (both full traversal and random access) as fast as an array.
