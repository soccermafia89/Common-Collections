Common-Collections
==================

Contains potentially faster implementations of Java collections.  New collection principles are based on big data database principles and lazy evaluation.  The goal is provide a List implementation that writes faster than array list, inserts and removes as fast as link lists, and reads (both traversal and random access) as fast as an array.
